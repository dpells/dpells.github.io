			<h1>Greetings Adventurers!</h1>
		</header>
		
		<section>
			<p>For the beginning of this journey we will be starting the adventure off in the city of Waterdeep, specifically <em>The Yawning Portal Inn.</em> Quickly, The Yawning Portal is a gathering place for adventurers known across Farun. You would likely be there seeking glory, a new adventure, riches, or perhaps you were already in Waterdeep and were looking for entertainment and stories. Durnan, the proprieter of our inn, has his own interesting backstory which you've only heard rumors of. Ask about it and I'll give you a piece of this interesting story, or you can make up your own outlandish stories about the man behind the bar.</p>
			
			<p>In order to help speed things along, there are a few faces in The Yawning Portal that your characters might be drawn to. As you're creating a character, pick 1- 2 <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FfcHpvhP2akEqoFkTn_E3ZKCfpyjxxB5">familiar faces</a> that your character might like to interact with in the inn. The folder also has a picture of the inn, as well as the <em>Code Legal</em> which is usually given out when travelers enter through the gates. If you're interested in more information about Waterdeep, Volos Waterdeep Enchiridion will be able to tell you more.</p>
			
			
			<h2>Core materials</h2>
			<p>Important things to look at:
				<ul>
						<li>Player's Handbook + <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PRqzXOzZlzCPF2h_3wg7XwLaFYO_bvG7?usp=sharing">Character sheet are required</a></li>
				  <li>Elemental Evil has some races</li>
				  <li>Sword Coast has some backgrounds</li>
				  <li>Xanathar's Guide will help develop backstories and provides random race/class/background options</li>
				  <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CIhtUPbA2h8CDZyIzewYVHsYOAtTcKi-?usp=sharing">Unearthed Arcana</a> might have some interesting material for you to try</li>
				</ul>
				I will have copies of books for you to use if you need them as well!
			</p>
		
			<h3>Character creation</h3>
			<p>I'm feeling quite generous regarding character stats. I trust everyone to roll stats and send them to me (one roll only). If they're really bad we can talk about rerolling them (bad sometimes can be good). There are a few options that I feel work for determining stats. 
				<ul>
					<li>Use the point buy system on page 13 of the PHB</li>
					<li>Roll 3d6 reroll 1s</li>
					<li>4d6 keep the best 3 (both give a mix of high and low)</li>
				</ul>
			Check out the backgrounds from Sword Coast Adventure Guide for more options, and Xanathar's Guide to Everything if you need inspiration/ideas for backgrounds.</p>

			<p>I want to encourage role playing. To help make your background worth it, check out the <a href="https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L-9CvlTWhoADagJfSZO">knife theory</a> with some example backstories from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/775caq/my_friends_and_i_have_something_called_knife/">subreddit</a>. This will help me create tie-ins for your character that will hopefully make the story part more interesting. I'm not making any promises to include each and every knife because that's too predictable, but it gives me something to create interest</p>

			<p>Also think about what you want out of the game? Are you hack and slashy, just want to roll dice and kill things? Do you want to really get into your character and make decisions based on their relationships in the game? Do you want big magic items, or towns to know your name? Let me know these things!</p>
			
			
			<h2>House "rules"</h2>
			<p>This is my first time as DM so I will be making mistakes but we'll role with it. If you have suggestions let me know!
				<ul>
					<li>If (when) I make a mistake with a rule and it's game breaking, let me know and I'll try to fix it in the moment or remember it moving forward</li>
					<li>I'm open to homebrew, but we'll need to discuss it. 
						<ul><li>Unearthed Arcana is open (if it's recent let me know about it so I can share it!)</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li>Multiclassing needs a story reason, not just a warlock wanting to wear heavy armour</li>
					<li>Let me know if there is anything I can do! This is for fun and I want to be flexible</li>
					<li>Make a wishlist of things you want to see in the game (specific/ generic/ custom magic items, NPCs you want to interact with)</li>
					<li>Have an idea for a secondary character in case something happens to current one</li>
					<li>Party dissension is allowed and can be quite fun, but it can divide a party (and a table) so proceed with caution</li>
					<li>If your character rubs everyone the wrong way don't get upset if they leave you behind and make you re-roll</li>
				</ul>

		<!--
		If you want to get ahead and role characters, we still need magic (wizard/sorcerer/warlock), healing (paladin/cleric/druid), and stealth (ranger/rogue/some monks). If you're all fighters, that works too. Feel free to role stats and send them to me. If they're really bad we can talk about rerolling. You can either point buy (pg13 PHB), roll 3d6 reroll 1s, or 4d6 keep best 3. Check out the backgrounds from Sword Coast Adventure Guide for more options, and Xanathars Guide to Everything if you need inspiration/ideas for backgrounds. I'll share all the source material I have, if you have any more send it to me and feel free to use it
