		<p>We're going to be in Waterdeep, specifically The Yawning Portal Inn. Quickly, The Yawning Portal is a gathering place for adventurers known across Farun. You would likely be there seeking glory, a new adventure, riches, or you were already in Waterdeep and were looking for entertainment and stories. Durnan has his own interesting backstory which you've only heard rumors of. Ask about it and I'll give you a piece of this interesting story</p>
    
    <p>Feel free to roll stats and send them to me (one roll only). If they're really bad we can talk about rerolling them (bad sometimes can be good). You can use the point buy syste on page 13 of the PHB, roll 3d6 reroll 1s, or 4d6 keep the best 3 (both give a mix of high and low). Check out the backgrounds from Sword Coast Adventure Guide for more options, and Xanathar's Guide to Everything if you need inspiration/ideas for backgrounds.</p>

		<p>I want to encourage role playing. To help make your background worth it, check out the <a href="https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L-9CvlTWhoADagJfSZO">knife theory</a> with some example backstories from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/775caq/my_friends_and_i_have_something_called_knife/">subreddit</a>. I'm not making any promises to include each and every knife because that's too predictable, but it gives me something to create interest</p>

    <p><b>Core materials</b><br>
		Important things to look at:
    <ul>
      <li>Player's Handbook + Character sheet are required</li>
      <li>Elemental Evil has some races</li>
      <li>Sword Coast has some backgrounds</li>
      <li>Xanathar's Guide will help develop backstories and provides random race/class/background options</li>
      <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CIhtUPbA2h8CDZyIzewYVHsYOAtTcKi-?usp=sharing">Unearthed Arcana</a> might have some interesting material for you to try</li>
    </ul>
		I will have copies of books for you to use if you need them as well!</p>

    <p><b>Waterdeep information</b><br>
		<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FfcHpvhP2akEqoFkTn_E3ZKCfpyjxxB5">Pick 1-2 familiar faces that your character has become friendly with</a></p>

    <p>This is my first time as DM so I will be making mistakes but we'll role with it. If you have suggestions let me know!</p>

    <p>Also think about what you want out of the game? Are you hack and slashy, just want to roll dice and kill things? Do you want to really get into your character and make decisions based on their relationships in the game? Do you want big magic items, or towns to know your name? Let me know these things!</p>

    <p><b>House rules</b>
    <ul>
		<li>If (when) I make a mistake with a rule and it's game breaking, let me know and I'll try to fix it in the moment or remember it moving forward</li>
		<li>I'm open to homebrew, but we'll need to discuss it. Unearthed Arcana is open (if it's recent let me know about it!)</li>
		<li>Multiclassing needs a story reason, not just a warlock wanting to wear heavy armour</li>
		<li>Let me know if there is anything I can do! This is for fun and I want to be flexible</li>
		<li>Make a wishlist of things you want to see in the game (specific/generic/custom magic items, NPCs you want to interact with)</li>
		<li>Have an idea for a secondary character in case something happens to current one</li>
		<li>Party dissension is allowed and can be quite fun, but it can divide a party (and a table)</li>
		<li>If your character rubs everyone the wrong way, don't get upset if they leave you behind</li>
    </ul></p>




		<!--
		If you want to get ahead and role characters, we still need magic (wizard/sorcerer/warlock), healing (paladin/cleric/druid), and stealth (ranger/rogue/some monks). If you're all fighters, that works too. Feel free to role stats and send them to me. If they're really bad we can talk about rerolling. You can either point buy (pg13 PHB), roll 3d6 reroll 1s, or 4d6 keep best 3. Check out the backgrounds from Sword Coast Adventure Guide for more options, and Xanathars Guide to Everything if you need inspiration/ideas for backgrounds. I'll share all the source material I have, if you have any more send it to me and feel free to use it
